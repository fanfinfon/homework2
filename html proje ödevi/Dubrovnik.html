        Situated on the <strong>Adriatic Sea</strong> coast, the city of Dubrovnik, historically called <strong>Ragusa</strong>, is part of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Croatia</a></strong>. This city, which houses several historical items from the Middle Ages, welcomes millions of tourists each year. In this city, which is well-known for its historical landmarks, it is fairly feasible to witness the consequences of the past. When Croatia broke away from <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Yugoslavia</a></strong> in 1991, internal strife seriously ruined the city's ancient monuments. However, after restoration work done in collaboration with UNESCO in 2005, the city largely recovered its original appearance. The city's historical districts were designated as World Heritage by <strong>UNESCO</strong> in 1979 and are now protected. Looking in from the outside, the city resembles a walled historical structure. </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lokrum" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lokrum Island</a></strong>, well-known for its beach and floral gardens, is also included.

      <p>In Dubrovnik, where majestic stone fortresses rise from the shimmering Adriatic Sea, the medieval and Mediterranean eras collide. See the entire city by strolling around the historic walls that encircle Old Town. Lined with palaces, terracotta rooftops, and Romanesque-Gothic monasteries, this place is the stuff that fantasies of Game of Thrones fans are made of (it was filmed here). There are many of beaches, most of them low-key and pebbly, but Copacabana Beach has a more clubby ambiance where you can spend the day jet skiing, drinking drinks, and sunbathing.</p>

            <p>Since Croatia is an EU country, it is no longer possible to enter the country without a visa. There are no direct flights from Turkey to Dubrovnik, so you must first fly from Istanbul Airport to Zagreb Airport and then to Dubrovnik.</p>

            <h3 id="When">When to Go to Dubrovnik?</h2>
            <p>In this city with a Mediterranean climate, it is preferable to visit during the winter months as the weather is not very cold, but if you want to have a beach holiday and enjoy the sun and the sea, the summer months will be very suitable for this.</p>
            <p>If you want to visit the city, see its walls, cathedrals, and examine its historical structure, autumn months will be more suitable.
                The fact that the winter and spring months receive a lot of rainfall and the summer months are very hot and dry will hinder the walks. Therefore, if you are not going for a summer holiday, the most suitable times will be the autumn months, but if you do not mind the rains, Lokrum Island can be visited in the spring months. The flowers blooming in the city's botanical gardens create a heavenly image. However, if there is a lot of rain, you may miss this opportunity and not be able to use Dubrovnik's famous cable car, as the boat tours on Lokrum Island will be canceled.</p>
            <p>If you go in May or June, you can explore the city from beginning to end without feeling too uncomfortable about the heat and enjoy the sea without being too crowded. Therefore, these two months are probably the most logical months to visit Dubrovnik.</p>
            <p>Dubrovnik Summer Festival, one of the most famous festivals in Dubrovnik, is a music and drama festival and is celebrated every year in July. If you want to feel the spirit of the Renaissance and Baroque periods, you can attend this festival in July. Those who will visit this city in June can attend the Libertas Film Festival and have the opportunity to watch independent short films that feature many cultures outdoors.</p>

            <p>Although Dubrovnik is very developed in terms of hotel accommodation, hotels are not preferred by travelers because they are located far from the city and are expensive. In this city, especially in the city center called Old Town, many homeowners turn their rooms into hotels and rent them out. This event is called SOBE and it is possible to find signs for SOBE on every street of the city. In addition, although there are many such places, it will be possible to find many hostels in the city.</p>
            <p>The Old Town area, seen as the heart of the city, is very suitable for accommodation. Although there are not many options in terms of hotels, SOBEs are quite numerous here. It would be more convenient to stay in this region, both in terms of transportation and proximity to all attractions. Staying somewhere in the Old Town also provides easy access to the beach, historical walls, markets and restaurants on foot.</p>
