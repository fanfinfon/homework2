      <p style= "color: black; font-style: italic;">-Copenhagen, as it is now known, was originally a fishing village called ‘Havn’ and it wasn’t until the late 12th century when Bishop Absalon, an advisor to Danish King Valdemar the Great, moved in that the city’s name changed.

        Fortifications were built around the emerging city and as trade continued to grow in the area it became known as Copenhagen.<br><br>-Copenhagen is well known for its love of cycling. The sheer amount of people that cycle regularly is around half of the population.<br><br>-Copenhagen is located by the sea. This gives the Scandinavian city a maritime flair, that is also reflected in the cuisine.<br><br>-Unfortunately, Copenhagen is quite expensive. This starts with the accommodation prices and carries on to the restaurants. So it’s best to allow a little more budget for a trip.<br><br>-The weather in Copenhagen can be quite variable.</p><br><br>
